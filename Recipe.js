    {name: "This page will tell you how to make easy plain nachos with cheese!"},
    {name: "There are only two ingredients needed for this. First, a fourteen ounce bag of tortilla chips, and second, a single pound of sharp cheddar cheese."},
    {name: "To begin cooking, heat the oven to 450 degrees Farenheit, and arrange a rack in the middle. While that happens, grate a pound of the sharp cheddar cheese. Use aluminum foil to line a baking sheet and spread about half of 14-ounce torilla chips bag evenly. Sprinkle half of the cheese over the chips evenly and repeat. Bake until the cheese is melty and gooey enough for about five minutes. Remove from the oven and get toppings if you'd like, serve right away, and enjoy!"},
